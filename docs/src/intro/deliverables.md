# Deliverables

During this bootcamp, learning is important, but something just as important as learning is putting things into practice.

Within the field of software development _[deliverable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliverable)_ is a 'good or service produced as a result of a project that is intended to be delivered to a customer'.

Think of us, the organizers, as your customer; what you during this event can be considered your deliverables for us!

Broken down into sections, the deliverables are as follows:

### 1. Hello World Flask Application, with a _twist_

-   Develop a Flask application, potentially using one of the examples provided in the Flask section of these docs as a base.
-   _But_, put your own twist on it, such as maybe making it return a random fruit name in comic sans, or a rainbow that changes over time.
