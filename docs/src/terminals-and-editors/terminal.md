# Quick Terminal Overview

Almost every operating system is equpied with a command-line interface or 'terminal', AKA Command Prompt on Windows. Terminals allow you to send commands to your computer to do various things like file management, installing applicatins, or controlling system configurations. In a nutSHELL, almost anything you can do with your mouse and keyboard can be done using commands.

#### Why command-line?
###### 1. Things can get done quicker
Okay hear me out, lets say you have a directory full of mixed type files and you want to delete all the .png files but keep the rest; how long will that take you to do using your mouse and keyboard?
Your answer doesnt matter, because this is how fast it is using a command: 
```sh
rm *.png
```
###### 2. You're in full control
