# Adding new blog posts

Within the example portfolio, adding a blog post is quite simple:

1. Create a new markdown file within the `./blog` directory

2. Name that file with the following format: `YYYY-MM-DD_TITLE`, such as:

`2020-10-04_Really great blog title here`

`2021-04-18_What I ate today, told via 6 cryptic haikus`

3. Fill the file with [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) content.
