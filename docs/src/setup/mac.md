# Mac

## Python

Mac ships with Python!

...but its Python 2.7...

So it's very important that you \_do not use your system Python to write code, since everything we'll be writing will be Python 3!

The guide ['Installing Python 3 on Mac OS X'](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/) over in the 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python' is great.

## Terminal

Mac is also ships with a terminal, for our use cases, the built in one is indeed _fine_.

If you're feeling fancy, give something like [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) a chance.

If you're feeling _dangerous_, try a hit of [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) or [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/).
