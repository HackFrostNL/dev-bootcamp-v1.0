## Lists

Unordered

-   Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
-   Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
    -   Marker character change forces new list start:
        -   Ac tristique libero volutpat at
        *   Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
        -   Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
-   Very easy!
