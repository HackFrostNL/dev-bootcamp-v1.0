# Example Portfolio

Within the repository on GitHub, you'll find a pre-built example portfolio application [here](https://github.com/HackFrostNL/dev-bootcamp-v1.0/tree/main/example-portfolio), that we've put together ourselves.

However, it is recommended not to take our code and copy it yourself, only to use it as a reference; the application is purposefully simple and lacking in basic things like a color palette, or much information, its simply is a reference.
