# Flask

[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) is the web framework of choice for this bootcamp, it is built for Python, and makes writing websites a lot more accessible to average developers.

Each example here shows how to build a different simple website using Flask.

## Development Server

While you're working on your application, it's a good idea to enable the development mode, so you'll get an interactive debugger, and reloading when code changes.
